1) you have a number of series in an array from 1-5... if i remove any number from this 
seq , so u need to find out which number is not present in an arry from that seq..

2) find the max number first and find its adjacents also min .. if your right or left adacents
not present in the array due to get the min max in the last or starting so u need to print on that 
side 0
